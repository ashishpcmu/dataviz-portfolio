# Portfolio
Welcome to my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU! This is where I’ll showcase my cool work that transforms raw data into compelling visual narratives. Whether it’s uncovering insights, building interactive dashboards, or crafting striking infographics, I’m all about making data meaningful and providing interesting contextual insights to the user. If you're looking for someone who can turn numbers into stories, you should probably hire me.

        Hi! I’m Ashish, a final year master's student in Information Systems at CMU Heinz College. I am passionate about data, and I love bringing it to life through visualizations. I find it exciting to discover patterns, trends, and hidden insights in a dataset and  finding the best way to communicate them to your users. Whether it’s designing interactive charts, experimenting with different visualization techniques, or telling a data-driven story, I’m always looking for creative ways to make information engaging and accessible to everyone. Outside of work, I love tennis, dance, music and travelling.

# What I hope to learn

I’m here to learn all the things—obviously! But more specifically, I want to explore best practices in effective data storytelling to an 
 audience, improve my ability to design effective and intuitive visualizations, and experiment with different tools and techniques. I’d also love to dive deeper into ways to make data more engaging for diverse audiences. Here is a list of things I am hoping to learn!

<span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">→ How to choose the best visualization graphs and charts for different datasets</span>  

<span style="color:green; font-style:italic;">→ Best practices for making charts engaging and understandable</span>  

<span style="color:purple; ">→ Tools like Tableau, and Datawrapper for creating visual stories</span>  

<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">→ How to use color, layout, and typography effectively</span>
