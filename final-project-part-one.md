# Outline

Artificial intelligence is everywhere—from your search engine results and virtual assistants to recommendation engines, image generators, and chatbot companions. These technologies appear seamless, smart, and almost magical. But what we don’t see is the massive, hidden workforce behind them—humans who spend long hours labeling images, moderating toxic content, and training models to act more "intelligent."

This hidden workforce is often located in developing countries, working under precarious conditions, for wages as low as $1.50 per hour. These people are the invisible labor behind AI. They power every impressive interaction we have with AI systems, yet their stories are rarely told. This project brings their work to the forefront—shedding light on how artificial intelligence depends not just on algorithms, but on human labor, often cheap and unrecognized.

We want to unpack the true cost of training AI, not just in dollars and compute, but in human lives, labor, and ethics. Using real data, global maps, and worker testimonies, our story reveals what it takes to “teach” a machine—and how the burden of that teaching falls on the world’s most vulnerable workers.

## Goal, Target Audience & Call to Action

## Goal Statement

Our goal is to expose and explain the hidden human labor required to train modern AI systems. We aim to educate audiences on the scale of this labor, the conditions under which it's performed, and the ethical questions it raises about fairness, transparency, and exploitation.

## Target Audience

- The general public who interact with AI tools daily.

- AI developers and product designers in tech companies.

- Journalists, educators, and students researching AI ethics.

- Policymakers and activists focused on labor rights and technology governance.

## Call to Action

- Recognize the human effort behind AI.

- Demand fair pay and mental health protections for data workers.

- Support policies that make AI supply chains transparent and ethical.

## Project Structure & Story Flow
> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.


### Section 1 - Introduction: The Illusion of Automation

We begin with a simple but provocative idea: AI isn’t as autonomous as it looks. From chatbots to self-driving cars, most AI systems rely heavily on data labeled by humans. This section introduces the reader to the concept of invisible labor and asks: If machines are learning, who are their teachers?

### Section 2 - What is Invisible Labor in AI?

This section defines the types of tasks human workers perform:

- Image labeling (e.g., "Is this a cat?")

- Moderating offensive or violent content

- Answering questions to train chatbots

- Ranking search engine results

We introduce key platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk, Scale AI, Appen, and Sama, where such labor is outsourced.

### Section 3 - Mapping the Global Workforce

Using a heatmap, we show how companies in Silicon Valley outsource labor to places like Kenya, the Philippines, Venezuela, and India. This section highlights economic disparities and visualizes global outsourcing pipelines.

### Section 4 - The Human Cost

Here we show:

- Wage comparisons (labelers vs. AI engineers)

- Mental health impacts of viewing disturbing content daily

- Worker testimonials from TIME, MIT Tech Review, and Fairwork reports

This is the emotional heart of the story. We want the audience to feel the weight of these workers’ experiences.

### Section 5 - What Can Be Done?
The final section contrasts two possible futures:

- Business-as-usual: Continued exploitation and opacity

- Fair AI future: Transparent sourcing, ethical guidelines, living wages

- We call on tech companies, consumers, and regulators to prioritize the latter.
