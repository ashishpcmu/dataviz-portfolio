# The final data story

https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/invisible-labor-in-ai/index.html



# Changes made since Part II

After Part II, I made the following changes to improve the narrative structure, visuals and call to action for the target audience based on the feedback.

### Use of Setup, Conflict and Resolution narrative structure

I changed the narrative structure to Setup, Conflict and Resolution framework to make it more engaging. I introduced the increasing investment in AI and the training data behind these models to setup a positive picture of AI. Then I showed a conflict where millions of workers around the world involved in this are exploited by big tech companies. The final resolution is showing evidence of ethical violations and increasing lawsuits using data visualizations to convince the audience to call for action by signing the pledge.

### Streamlined Data Visualizations using multiple chart types with uniform color palette

I used multiple chart types, like line charts, bar graphs, maps, pie chart and area graphs to show the insights from data analysis. Since the theme was dark and negative, I maintained a uniform red to orange color scheme throughout the charts for consistency. 

### Changed Call to action

Based on feedback, I changed the call to action to sign an "Ethical AI pledge" to make it more actionable and interactive. I created a Google form where the audience can sign the AI pledge to support ethical AI practices and demand accountability from the big tech companies (https://forms.gle/iAfCLGaRPFk888g78). 

### Created data for mapping AI labour

Since there was no formal dataset available for mapping countries where invisible AI labour was primarily located, I collected the information from various sources like news articles, research papers to create a dataset of countries where AI data labelling was being done. I divided these countries into 3 groups - 1. where exploitation was most based on countries frequently cited in labour exploitation lawsuits 2. where data labelling labour was existent but not mentioned in exploitation reference 3. where data labelling was a regulated job with minimum wage requirements being followed (eg. Europe). Then I color coded the AI labour in a red to orange palette with red being the most exploited countries.

### Changed the images to publically available images from Unsplash

In Part II, there were some images which had copyrights on them. So I changed all the images in the Shorthand story to include only images from Unsplash. 

## The audience

For my final data story, I identified two key audience groups: the general public who interact with AI tools daily, and journalists, educators, and students researching AI ethics. I narrowed this focus based on insights gathered from interviews and existing personas that emphasized growing concerns around AI's societal impact, particularly regarding invisible labor. 

To better reach the general public, I simplified technical jargon and used relatable examples of everyday AI use in captchas and social media use. For journalists and educators, I incorporated clear, sourced data points and visualizations that provided evidence of exploitation of the invisible AI workers. The call to action was also modified to sign an AI pledge, so the target audience can take action regarding this issue.



## Final design decisions


For the Invisible Labor in AI story, I made several key design decisions to better align the project with the needs of my audience and enhance its overall impact. 

- One major shift was adopting the Setup-Conflict-Resolution narrative structure, which helped create a more engaging and persuasive flow — beginning with the excitement around AI, moving into the hidden exploitation of data workers, and ending with a call to action through the Ethical AI Pledge.

- I also streamlined the data visualizations by using multiple chart types while maintaining a consistent red-to-orange color palette to match the serious, urgent tone of the topic. 

- I used a consitent dark theme (red, grey and black colors) throughout the story to maintain the negative tone of the story.

- I made a button in the final call to action page which linked to a google form containing the Ethical AI pledge.

Reflecting on the process, one key learning was how critical it is to have a coherent design theme — like tone, colors, and interactivity - to match the emotional and ethical dimensions of the topic. These changes not only made the story more engaging and impactful for a broad audience but also ensured that users were encouraged to take tangible action.

# Final thoughts

Overall, working on the Invisible Labor in AI story was both challenging and rewarding. I felt that the narrative and visual structure came together well to tell a compelling story. There were  a few things I wish I had more time to refine. For instance, I  wanted to include quotes from actual data labelers to add a more personal, human dimension to the story, but I did not have time to integrate those interviews due to 1 minute time limit for presentation.

One thing I was particularly excited about was the Ethical AI Pledge — it felt empowering to not just present a problem, but to offer the audience a way to actively engage with it. It was gratifying to see how a carefully designed call to action could make the data story feel more participatory rather than passive.

This project also reinforced for me how critical it is to think about audience empathy — not just what we want to say, but how it will be received emotionally and cognitively.  Overall, I’m glad how the final story turned out, and it gave me a deeper appreciation for the power of insightful storytelling through data visualizations in shaping meaningful thoughts and conversations.
