# Draft Narrative Development

Building on Part I, this draft narrative focuses on walking the reader through the human and ethical considerations behind the AI they interact with daily. The story is being developed in Shorthand, with supporting high-fidelity visualizations designed in Tableau.

The draft includes:

- Narrative in Shorthand : https://preview.shorthand.com/7t9apo3C4MkILMUw



# Wireframes / storyboards

Below is a walkthrough of the current structure, supported by visual wireframes (embedded in Shorthand prototype):

## Slide 1: What is Invisible Labour?

Content: Introduce Invisible Labour in AI training


## Slide 2: Mapping the Labor

Content: Tableau heatmap of labor hubs (Kenya, Philippines, India, Venezuela).


## Slide 3: Human Cost & Lawsuits

Content: Stats on average pay, working hours, job security

Graphs: 

- Bar graph: Earnings per hour (annotator vs. software engineer).
- Quotes from TIME, Fairwork, and MIT Tech Review.
- Mental health implications of content moderation.

## Slide 4: AI Ethical risks

Content: Ethical considerations of AI training - increasing wealth disparities and exploitation

## Slide 5: What’s Next?

Split panel: Ethical AI Future vs. Status Quo.

## Interview findings


### d. User Research Findings

| Questions                                              | Interview 1 (Grad Student)                                                              | Interview 2 (Grad Student)                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| What stood out to you in the story?                    | The wage gap visuals and heatmap were nice and made the issue feel immediate.     | The countries heatmap helped see the distribution in low income countries.                 |
| Was anything unclear or confusing?                     | Nothing much as such.                                 | Slight confusion around how these tasks help in AI models.            |
| Did any visuals help you understand the topic better?  | The bar chart on earnings made the disparity clear.                              | The map showing outsourcing hotspots was very effective.                            |
| Did you feel empathy for the workers? Why or why not?  | Yes – especially after reading about content moderation and burnout.          | Yes – the narrative made me think about my own use of AI and its hidden costs.        |
| Is the call to action compelling and clear?            | Somewhat – could use a more direct “here’s what you can do” list.                        | Suggested adding a donation or petition link for more tangible action.                |
| What would you add or change?                          | Move the worker quotes earlier in the experience.                                        | Emphasize global inequality more clearly in the stats.                                |
| Did the color scheme work for the tone?                | Dark theme was effective — matched the emotional vibe of the topic.                      | Yes - keeps focus on the seriousness of labor issues.                                 |




# Identified changes for Part III

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Use Narrative structure | Add sections in Setup, Conflict and Resolution format |
| More Compelling CTA     |           Possibly add a Donate Now button (Need some research on this)                                                                |
|    Add data on range of salaries            |         Bar graph showing range of salaries across AI tasks                                     |
