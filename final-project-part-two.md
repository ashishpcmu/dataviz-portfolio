## Interview findings


### d. User Research Findings

| Questions                                              | Interview 1 (Grad Student)                                                              | Interview 2 (Grad Student)                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| What stood out to you in the story?                    | The wage gap visuals and heatmap were nice and made the issue feel immediate.     | The countries heatmap helped see the distribution in low income countries.                 |
| Was anything unclear or confusing?                     | Nothing much as such.                                 | Slight confusion around how these tasks help in AI models.            |
| Did any visuals help you understand the topic better?  | The bar chart on earnings made the disparity clear.                              | The map showing outsourcing hotspots was very effective.                            |
| Did you feel empathy for the workers? Why or why not?  | Yes – especially after reading about content moderation and burnout.          | Yes – the narrative made me think about my own use of AI and its hidden costs.        |
| Is the call to action compelling and clear?            | Somewhat – could use a more direct “here’s what you can do” list.                        | Suggested adding a donation or petition link for more tangible action.                |
| What would you add or change?                          | Move the worker quotes earlier in the experience.                                        | Emphasize global inequality more clearly in the stats.                                |
| Did the color scheme work for the tone?                | Dark theme was effective — matched the emotional vibe of the topic.                      | Yes - keeps focus on the seriousness of labor issues.                                 |
