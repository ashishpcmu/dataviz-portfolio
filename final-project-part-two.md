# Draft Narrative Development

Building on Part I, this draft narrative focuses on walking the reader through the ethical and human realities behind the AI they interact with daily. The story is being developed in Shorthand, with supporting high-fidelity visualizations designed in Tableau, Flourish, and Datawrapper.

The draft includes:

- Scroll-based narrative in Shorthand

- Visual introduction: "AI Isn't Magic – It's Human Labor"

- Global heatmap: Annotator locations across the globe (Tableau)

- Bar chart: Wage comparison – data annotators vs. AI engineers (Datawrapper)

- Quote carousel: Worker testimonials and lived experiences (Flourish)

- Split-screen: Future with and without labor transparency in AI supply chains



# Wireframes / storyboards

Below is a walkthrough of the current structure, supported by visual wireframes (embedded in GitHub and Shorthand prototype):

## Slide 1: Illusion of Autonomy

Animation: AI responding to user query → Flashback to worker labeling similar data.

Text overlay: "AI doesn’t learn alone. It needs thousands of human teachers."

## Slide 2: What Is Invisible Labor?

Illustration of tasks: Content moderation, image labeling, speech annotation.

Visual metaphor: Factory-style conveyor belt, with workers manually tagging data.

## Slide 3: Mapping the Labor

Tableau heatmap of labor hubs (Kenya, Philippines, India, Venezuela).

Stats on average pay, working hours, job security.

## Slide 4: Human Cost

Carousel of quotes from TIME, Fairwork, and MIT Tech Review.

Datawrapper bar graph: Earnings per hour (annotator vs. software engineer).

Sidebar: Mental health implications of content moderation.

## Slide 5: What’s Next?

Split panel: Ethical AI Future vs. Status Quo.

CTA buttons: Learn More | Support Fairwork | Contact Policy Makers

Storyboard images and high-fidelity visuals are embedded in the GitHub repo.

### d. User Research Findings

| Questions                                              | Interview 1 (Data Scientist)                                                              | Interview 2 (Grad Student in Policy)                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| What stood out to you in the story?                    | The wage gap visuals and heatmap were “startling” and made the issue feel immediate.     | The personal quotes resonated the most and helped humanize the story.                 |
| Was anything unclear or confusing?                     | Sankey diagram felt “too abstract” without clear legend.                                 | Slight confusion around which tasks were performed by humans vs. machines.            |
| Did any visuals help you understand the topic better?  | The bar chart on earnings made the disparity crystal clear.                              | The map showing outsourcing hotspots was “very effective.”                            |
| Did you feel empathy for the workers? Why or why not?  | Yes – especially after reading the quotes about content moderation and burnout.          | Yes – the narrative made me think about my own use of AI and its hidden costs.        |
| Did the story change how you see AI?                   | Definitely. I’ll never think of “automated” tools the same way again.                    | It made me reflect on the ethics of the tech tools I use and promote in policy work.  |
| Is the call to action compelling and clear?            | Somewhat – could use a more direct “here’s what you can do” list.                        | Suggested adding a donation or petition link for more tangible action.                |
| What would you add or change?                          | Move the worker quotes earlier in the experience.                                        | Emphasize global inequality more clearly in the stats.                                |
